<p> My name is Michael Bottalico. I work two jobs, one as a Bus Boy at a Mexican restaurant and the other as a part-time mechanic. I like to spend my free time binge-watching t.v and/or watching baseball (when it's baseball season). But lately i've been spending most of my free time working on code.<br>
 I recieved my Associates degree in Social Sciences from Brookdale Community College a little over a year ago. After realizing that I wanted something different, I decided to change my direction and I came across an opportunity. It wasn't always a dream of mine to be a web developer but once I stumbled across it, I knew this was what I wanted to do. Web development is my new found passion and i'm determined to succeed. </p>
